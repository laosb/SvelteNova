# Svelte Nova

Svelte support for Nova, with `tree-sitter`-based syntax highlighting and
language server support.

Needs `node` installed for starting
[Svelte Language Server](https://github.com/sveltejs/language-tools/tree/master/packages/language-server).

Inspired by & took code pieces from
[`nova-vue`](https://github.com/tommasongr/nova-vue) and
[`nova-typescript`](https://github.com/apexskier/nova-typescript).

For Nova 10 & up, this extension is using `tree-sitter` grammar from
[`Himujjal/tree-sitter-svelte`](https://github.com/Himujjal/tree-sitter-svelte).

Thanks for Svelte team & Panic for delivering their masterpieces!
