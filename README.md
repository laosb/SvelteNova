# Svelte Nova

Svelte support for Nova.

Needs `node` installed for starting [Svelte Language Server](https://github.com/sveltejs/language-tools/tree/master/packages/language-server).

Inspired by & took code pieces from [`nova-vue`](https://github.com/tommasongr/nova-vue) and [`nova-typescript`](https://github.com/apexskier/nova-typescript).

Thanks for Svelte team & Panic for delivering their masterpieces!
